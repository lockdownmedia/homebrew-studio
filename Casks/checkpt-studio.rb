# Canonical CheckPt Studio Homebrew cask.
#
# This file is the source of truth for the cask published to the
# `lockdownmedia/homebrew-studio` tap. The `studio-release-publish.yml`
# workflow copies it into the tap (on first publish) and then rewrites the
# `version` + both `sha256` values from the release's `index.json` via
# `tools/release/update-homebrew-cask.js` on every subsequent publish.
#
# The URLs interpolate `#{version}` so a bump only ever touches the version
# line and the two sha256 literals — keeping the per-release diff minimal.
# See apps/studio/RELEASE.md for the tap + secret setup.
